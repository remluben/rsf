A collection of classes building a simple PHP based MVC framework

This project is intended for providing a collection of classes as implemented and described within 
<b>O'Reilly's PHP Design Patterns</b> by Stefan Schmidt.

It shows the usage of the MVC design pattern as a composition of multiple other design patterns described within the book.

<b>Note:</b>
The "model" part of the MVC pattern is not implemented within the example framework.
As described within the book, there exists a couple of well supported ORMs, which will help developing the business logic of applications.

TODO
====

* PHPUnit tests
* Improve the framework AutoLoader class, so framework class directories do not have to be added manually within examples
* Improve README and documentation
